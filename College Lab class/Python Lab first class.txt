Python is dynamic:
Any variable can be int, str, or any other data type.

#Uses of colon:
1. class definition
2. method definition
3. loop
4. ifelse

#Parameter vs Argument
Parameter -- given to the method while declaration
argument -- given while calling the method or class

Constructor is(should always be) always the first method in the class
def __init__()  also called Magic method

method if inside class
function if outside class

this --- self

Self should always be the first parameter in every method
Self is used to call the attrbs of the current class as global scope

#keyword.kwlist  To show keyword list.

camelConvention

# for comment

+ for concatenation


#Typecastig or type conversion.

int()
str()


#String as Data structure
String is a data structure.
because it carries a sequence of characters.

For ex: "abc" is a sequence of a,b and c.

#Mutability:
String is not mutable. it needs to be replaced explicitly to change or modify.

Lists are mutable. They get modified after implementing any method.


#
var.capitalize() to capitalize the first character
var.upper() to capitalize the whole string.

#Slicing

[starting index:Exclusion position index : Jump]

Starting index - 0 as default
Jump - 0 as default




#List:

adding single data:
listName.append()

adding multiple data:
listName.extend([])


removing last entry:
listName.pop()

Selecting multiple entry: #Slicing
listName[::]



#If else in Python
