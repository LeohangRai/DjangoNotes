All the commands used:
#django-admin startproject projectname
#python manage.py runserver
django-admin : creates the project


Collection of apps is website.
So all the projects that we are working on are websites
Each feature is an app
Think of apps as components, rather than just apps.


To run any python file, write 
python filename.py

#python manage.py runserver

To stop the server: CTRL + C

#python manage.py startapp main



manage.py is used to runserver and startapp


SQL injection :
extracts admin login info
Mainly happens due to secret key vulnerability



urls.py is gateway interface (it is the controller) --> I think I meant wsgi.py
urls.py initially/automatically only exists in the first folder, so we need to copy paste it into the app folder that we work on next.
The urls.py of the first (automatic one) should point to the ones we make




from . import methodName/className

. means from the current directory



path('',views.homepage, name="homepage" ), #go to homepage when the URL is empty
    


Models are only in the main app

from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class Tutorial(models.Model):

Model is imported for the primary key and other DB features


#Difference between CharField and TextField:
CharField has max_limit

For each change in the models.py, we should run 2 commands:
1. makemigrations
2. migrate

These commands are run in the manage.py file


python manage.py makemigrations
nochangedetected----> because the app has not been registered.

python manage.py migrate
This must create a folder named 'migrations' which will have a file named 0001_inittial.py


DB
1 class is 1 tabe
1 row is 1 obj

View:
doesn't render, it only requests, and the controller responds
