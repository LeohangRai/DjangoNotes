<slug>
<int:id>
<int: pk>

Slug is used to make the URLs dynamic


Slug is also a type?
Any other method to pass arg through the URL?
User doesn't know the PK or id...so willl 


While adding delete, update, post <int:id> or sth, we will always need to have a form int


You can call the view function through the static file like:
action = "{% url 'main:function_name' %}


redirect(appname:name)
name is the path wala name.
