#URL routing and requests


#Views
(Creating Defualt and custom homepage)

-this file handles all the web pages.
-Using functions or classes 

#Urls
- this file is like the router for each page
-adding path to this file for each page to be redirected to


Example:
#views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse 

def home_view(*args, **kwargs):
 	return	HttpResponse("<h1> Hello world </h1>")  #String of Html code
def contact_view(*args, **kwargs):
	return HttpResponse("<h1>This is the contact page</h1>") 

#urls.py (From main app)
from pages.views import home_view, contact_view

	path('', home_view, name = 'home')
	path('home/', home_view, name ='home')  #Both empty url and home will give the same output
	path('contact/' contact_view)

Note: This way, you won't have to create a urls.py file for the new app.

Note:
print(args, kwargs)
print(request)
print(request.user)

pathname/   if this is done inside the urls.py in application, then it exists independently.
/pathname  if this is done, then it exists inside prevfoldername/pathname
