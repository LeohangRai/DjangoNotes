#Templates in Django: (DTL: Django Template Language)
--->In any html page, we can have dynaimc content.
    The page can have a single layout with dynamic content 


render is used instead of HttpResponse here:
because we have to merge the html file(static content) and dynamic content to render the output 	

#Steps:
1. Create the templates folder (can be named sth else rather than just templates)
2. Go to settings.py and add [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')]    #templates because it is the folder name, can be anything else as per the name of the folder
3. Go to views.py and do the following:
 	def pagename(request):
		return render(request, 'pagename.html')


Note:   {{}} or {% %} These both are used in jinja patterns

#Extra: (Jinja pattern)
If you want to make any content in the html file dynamic:

views.py:
return render(request, 'pagename.html', '{'name':'Leo'}')

html page:
Hello {{name}} !!

This will print "Hello Leo"
