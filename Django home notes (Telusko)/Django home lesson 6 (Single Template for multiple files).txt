In multiple pages for a single site, most pages might have the same layout with different content.
We can create a separate file that holds the properties(design) that are common in all these pages.
And then extend it in other html files with jinja

We can achieve this by doing the following:

In the new html file, that is going to have all the layout features add: (Inside the body)
#base.html
<html>
<body>
{% block content %}

{% endblock %}
<body>
</html>

And now to extend this html file in any other html file:
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}

html content/code

{% endblock %}

--> This will  make the html file inherit all the properties from the base.html file.
