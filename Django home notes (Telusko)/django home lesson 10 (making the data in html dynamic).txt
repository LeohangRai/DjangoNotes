We can add data into the html file dynamically.
First create a class in models.py with the attributes required.
Then pass the values through the views.py file into the html file.


For example:

#models.py
class Destination:
	id: int
	name: str
	desc: str
	price: int

Note: We are doing manually only for learning. This will get easier after connecting to the DB
#views.py
from .models import Destination

def index(request):
	dest1 = Destination() #Creating an object(i.e a row) of Destination class/table

	dest.name = 'Kathmandu'	
	dest.desc ='City of temples'
	dest.price = 500

	return render(request, "index.html", {'dest1':dest1})

#index.html
Now, wherever you find the name, description and price of the destination, we can replace them with:
{{dest1.name}}
{{dest1.desc}}
{{dest1.price}}

Note: For another destination, we can create another class named 'dest2' and repeat the same process.


#Using array of objects:
we can pass all the objects through an array into the dictionary.

For example, we  have 3 objs 'dest1, dest2, dest3'.
We can create an array as:  
dests = [dest1, dest2, dest3]
