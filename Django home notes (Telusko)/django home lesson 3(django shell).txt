#Opening the python shell.
Make sure you are in the directory that has the manage.py file.
Open cmd there.
>python manage.py shell


Now you are in the shell.
So you cam import classes from models and work with them like in SQL. (select, insert, etc.)

Example:
>>>from products.models import Product      #imports the Product class/table from the models.py file
>>>Product.objects.all()                #returns all the objects from Product class
>>>Product.objects.create()   #You can fill up the attribs inside the parameter like (title='', description = '',....)


To delete all the changes you have made:
Delete the pychache folder in the migrations module [Leave the __init__ file inside it]
Also, delete the dbsqLite3 file to delete the whole DB
