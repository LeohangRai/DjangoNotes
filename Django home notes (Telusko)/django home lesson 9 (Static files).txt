We need to place all the static files of the template (HTML) in a separate folder in the main project.
In the example, we have named it 'static'

We have to tell django that we have placed all the static files in a separate folder by coding in the settings.py:

Do the following:
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
	os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')  #path of the static files' folder added with the BASE Path
]


Django will take all the files from this static folder and keep them in its own separate folder (for more efficiency) as we code below:

STATIC_ROOT = [
	os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'assets')
]

We will have to tell django to copy all the files from our static folder to its own folder (assests) through CLI:
>python manage.py collectstatic

Now there shall be a new folder named 'assets' in the base directory with all the files from the static folder.



Now, in the html file, wherever there is a reference (href) and path, we need to show that the static (css, js, img) files are inside the static folder.

We can do this by using jinja by:
First loading the static folder:
{% load static %}  #Do this on top of the html file.

Changing: 
href="plugins/OwlCarousel2-2.2.1/owl.carousel.css"
Into:
href=" {% static 'plugins/OwlCarousel2-2.2.1/owl.carousel.css' %}"

Note: 'static' is the name of the folder that has the static files	


Change:
<img src="images/destination_1.jpg" alt="">
To:
<img src="{% static 'images/destination_1.jpg' %}" alt="">
