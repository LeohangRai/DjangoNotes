>django-admin startproject projectname  [Django-admin creates the project]


>python manage.py createsuperuser
----> will ask for username, email and pw


>python manage.py runserver
To stop the server: CTRL + C


>python manage.py startapp appname
-----> will create a folder for the app 
After creating any app, go to settings.py to add the app in the INSTALLED_APPS field manually.



Then: 
>python manage.py makemigrations
>python manage.py migrate

Note: 
These two commands are to be run in conjunction everytime a change is made to the models.py file

models.py: (Of the app we created)
To create a database:

class TableName(models.Model):
	attrb name = models.InputType()


Example:
class Products(models.Model):
	title = models.TextField()
	description = models.TextField()


#Important Note:
Every time a new app is created, we need to add them into the INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py

After creating the model, we have to register the model, i.e. the class in the admin.py file:

from .models import Product     #Product is a class/table
admin.site.register(Product)
