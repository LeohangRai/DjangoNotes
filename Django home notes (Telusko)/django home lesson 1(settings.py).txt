Root of the project == the dir where manage.py is located.
We have to open the cmd at the directory where manage.py file is located.


#Settings.py:

import os  ----> so it runs on all OS (Mac, linux, windows)

BASE_DIR ----> points the path of the project

SECRET_KEY ----> Unique to the project. Used for security. You can make changes to it.

INSTALLED_APPS----> This is where we develop our apps for the site...There are already a bunch of apps pre-installed. This is where we put our own apps as well as third party apps.

Think of apps as components, rather than just apps.

MIDDLEWARE----> how requests and security are handled

ROOT_URLCONF 

TEMPLATES ----> 

WSGI-APPLICATION

DATABASES---> 


STATIC_URL ---> where your javascript, images and css. 

Note: Every time a new app is created, we need to add them into the INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py


>python manage.py migrate ----> This syncs our settings with our django project and whatever app we have.
