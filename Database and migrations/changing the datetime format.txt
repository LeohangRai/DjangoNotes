We can use filters in the template to display the date in the format we want.

For example:
If we want to show in the fullmonth, day and year format as:
July 4, 2020

Then we can use this filter:

{{ post.date_posted | date:"F d, Y" }}

NOTE: There should not be any whitespace between the colon and the inverted comma in date:""

Here F refers to full month
d refers to day in numbers stating with 0
Y refers to year

#NOTE
We can customize these formats by looking at the documentation.
The documentation shows what stands for what.
