First we need to run:
python manage.py makemigrations

Then:
python manage.py sqlmigrate <app_name> <migration_num>

NOTE: You can find the migration number in the migration file.
For example, in the migration file 001_initial.py, the migration number is:
001


The migration file is generated once we run the makemigrations command.
