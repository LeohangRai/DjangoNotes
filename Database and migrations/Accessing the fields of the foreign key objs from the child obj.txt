we have 2 models.
1. Blog (title, content, date_posted, author(fk))
2. User (username, email, pw)

Here, we see that Blog uses User as the foreign key.

Now if we have a Blog object.
Then we can access the fields of the foreign key object that this Blog object points to.


For example:

blog1 = Blog.objects.first()

Now that we have a blog object, we can use it's corresponding foreing key object's fields as:

blog1.author
> This will return the user/author object

blog1.author.email
> this will return the user/author's email

blog1.author.username 
> This will return the user/author's username
