#Syntax:
modelname_set

we have 2 models.
1. Blog (title, content, date_posted, user(fk))
2. User (username, email, pw)

Here, we see that Blog uses User as the foreign key.

Now if we have a User object.
Then we can access the objects that point to this User object as their foreign key.

userobj = User.objects.all().first()
userobj.post_set.all()

> This will return all the posts that have fk as that userobj


We can even create new Post objects using this User object as:
userobj.post_set.create(title = 'Blog 4', content = 'Hey this is me')

Notice here, we didn't even have to specify the user for this post because, django already knows that we
created this post for this user.

So this will be automatically saved into the database, without having to run the save() method.
